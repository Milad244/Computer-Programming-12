1. Do I need to write 'as a type' in param javadoc? The javadoc already says it so it feels redundant.
Ex: * @param massKg The mass of the planet in kg as a double OR * @param massKg The mass of the planet in kg
2. Should I count a word with an apostrophe in it as one word in Module 2.4 Word line 33?
3. My encryption conserves spaces but removes any special characters and lowers capital letters. Is that satisfactory?
4. I only realized this after completing my Cipher but I made it so the code works for any shift key (not just 0-25) is that okay?
