Questions:
- Should I include height and width in toString even when it may be a default value of 0?
- Should I make my default params in triangle null instead of 0?
- Should I include rotation in my constructor?
- I cannot name a package 'module1.1' or '1'. Therefore, I used underscores instead. Is that okay?
- Is there a rule of thumb as to when I should use javadoc for a method. I assume ambiguous or complicated methods would
require them but in this assignment that would rule them all out.
- Should I comment stuff that organizes? E.g. // fields or // getters and setters for triangle sides
- Should I consider false values? E.g. negative side numbers? If so, I assume I give it a default value if false value?

TO DO:
- Add test cases
- improve main class
