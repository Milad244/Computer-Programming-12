Questions:
- Should I include height and width in toString even when it may be a default value of 0?
- Should I make my default params in triangle null instead of 0?
- Should I include rotation in my constructor?
- I cannot name a package 'module1.1' or '1'. Therefore, I used underscores instead. Is that okay?
- Is there a rule of thumb as to when I should use javadoc for a method. I assume ambiguous or complicated methods would
require them but in this assignment that would rule all out all.

TO DO:
- Properly comment code
- Add test cases
- improve main class
